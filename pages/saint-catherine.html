    <p>Prayer for the Intercession of Saint Catherine of Siena<br>
      
	<script src="index.js"></script>


O marvelous wonder of the Church,
seraphic virgin, Saint Catherine,
because of your extraordinary virtue
and the immense good
which you accomplished for the Church and society,
you are acclaimed and blessed by all people.
O blessed Catherine,
turn your benign countenance towards me,
who confident of your powerful patronage
call upon you with all the ardor of affection
and I beg you to obtain by your prayers
the favors I so ardently desire

(mention your request).

You, who were a victim of charity,
who in order to benefit your neighbor
obtained from God the most stupendous miracles
and became the joy and the hope of all;
you cannot help but hear the prayers
of those who fly to you heart,
that heart which you received
from the Divine Redeemer in a celestial ecstasy.

O seraphic virgin,
show once again proof of your power
and of your flaming charity,
so that your name shall ever be blessed and exalted;
grant that we,
having experienced your most efficacious intercession here on earth,
may come one day to thank you in Heaven
and enjoy eternal happiness with you.

Amen.
